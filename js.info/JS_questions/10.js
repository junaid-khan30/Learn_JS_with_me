/*Analyze the following code block and write the output along with 4-5 lines of reasoning.*/
var t = 11;
var j = 11.45;
var p = -111.6567;
var q = 22 / 7;
console.log(typeof t, typeof j, typeof p, typeof q);
/* var t = 11;
t is assigned the value 11, which is an integer.

var j = 11.45;
j is assigned the value 11.45, which is a floating-point number or a decimal number.

var p = -111.6567;
p is assigned the value -111.6567, which is also a floating-point number.

var q = 22 / 7;
q is assigned the value of the result of 22 divided by 7, which is approximately 3.142857142857143. Again, this is a floating-point number.

console.log(typeof t, typeof j, typeof p, typeof q);
This line prints the type of each variable using the typeof operator.

Output: "number number number number"
Reasoning: The typeof operator returns the type of the operand as a string. Since all variables (t, j, p, and q) are assigned numeric values, their types are all "number". */
