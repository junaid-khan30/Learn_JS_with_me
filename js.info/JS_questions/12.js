/*Analyze the following code block and write the output along with 4-5 lines of reasoning.*/

var a = "Walter";
var b = "Prash";
console.log(a + b);
console.log('"WalterPrash"');
console.log("\"WalterPrash\"");
console.log(`"${a}${b}"`);
console.log(`"${a}\t\n${b}"`);
/* console.log(a + b);
Output: "WalterPrash"
Reasoning: The + operator is used to concatenate the values of a and b. Therefore, "Walter" and "Prash" are combined to form "WalterPrash", which is the output.

console.log('"WalterPrash"');
Output: "WalterPrash"
Reasoning: The console.log() function is used to output the string literal "WalterPrash", which is enclosed in double quotes. The output will be the same string.

console.log("\"WalterPrash\"");
Output: "WalterPrash"
Reasoning: Here, the string literal "WalterPrash" is enclosed in double quotes and escaped using the backslash (\) to include the double quotes within the string. The output will be the same string.

console.log("${a}${b}");
Output: "WalterPrash"
Reasoning: This line uses string interpolation with the template literal syntax (${}) to concatenate the values of a and b within double quotes. The output will be the same string, "WalterPrash".

console.log("${a}\t\n${b}");
Output: "Walter Prash"
Reasoning: This line uses string interpolation with the template literal syntax to concatenate the values of a and b within double quotes. The special characters \t and \n are used to represent a tab and a new line, respectively. The output will be "Walter", followed by a tab character, a new line, and then "Prash".`*/
