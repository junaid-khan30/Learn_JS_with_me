/*Analyze the following code block and write the output along with 4-5 lines of reasoning.*/
var str = "";
for (var i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    str += i;
    console.log(str);
}/*The code block initializes an empty string variable str.
The for loop is executed 10 times, starting from i = 1 and incrementing i by 1 in each iteration until i reaches 10.
Inside the loop, the value of i is concatenated to the str variable using the += operator. This appends the current value of i to the existing string.
After each concatenation, the console.log statement is called to print the updated str.
As a result, the loop builds a string by appending the numbers from 1 to the current value of i in each iteration, and the console.log statement prints the updated string on each iteration.
In summary, the code block generates a sequence of strings where each string includes the numbers from 1 to the current value of i in the loop. The output displays the string after each iteration, resulting in a pyramid-like pattern of increasing numbers. */
