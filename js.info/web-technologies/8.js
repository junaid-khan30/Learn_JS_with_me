/*Analyze the following code block and write the output along with 4-5 lines of reasoning.*/
var fname = "prash";
var age = 99;
var temp = "trash";
var user = {
    fname, age, temp
}
console.log(user);
console.log(user.temp);
console.log(); 
/* he code block initializes three variables: fname with the value "prash", age with the value 99, and temp with the value "trash".
The user object is created using object literal syntax, and its properties fname, age, and temp are assigned the corresponding values from the variables with the same names.
The console.log(user) statement outputs the entire user object, which consists of the properties fname, age, and temp along with their respective values.
The console.log(user.temp) statement accesses the temp property of the user object and outputs its value, which is "trash".
The console.log() statement with no arguments will output an empty line.*/
