/*Analyze the following code block and write the output along with 4-5 lines of reasoning.*/
var num = 2;
for (var i = 1; i <= 15; i++) {
    console.log(`2 x ${i} = ${2 * i}`);
}
/* The code block initializes the variable num with the value 2.
The for loop is executed 15 times, starting from i = 1 and incrementing i by 1 in each iteration until i reaches 15.
Within the loop, the console.log statement prints a formatted string that displays the multiplication table for num.
The string template uses the value of i to calculate 2 * i and displays it as part of the output.
As a result, the loop generates and prints the multiplication table for 2 from 2 x 1 to 2 x 15, displaying the multiplication results for each iteration.*/
