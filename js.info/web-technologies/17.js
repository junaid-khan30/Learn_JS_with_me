/*Analyze the following code block and write the output along with 4-5 lines of reasoning.*/
var data = [[1, 3, 4], [9, 9], [2, 5, 6, 7, 8], [99], [0, 0, 0, 100]];
var data2 = [];
var counter = 0;

    for (var j = 0; j < data[i].length; j++) {

}
console.log(data2);
/* The code block defines a multidimensional array data containing several nested arrays with different lengths.
An empty array data2 and a variable counter are initialized.
The code enters a nested for loop to iterate over each element in the data array.
Inside the nested loop, each element of data is accessed using data[i][j], where i represents the outer loop index and j represents the inner loop index.
The current element is assigned to the corresponding index in data2 using data2[counter] = data[i][j], and then the counter variable is incremented.
This process continues until all elements in data have been processed.
Finally, the resulting data2 array, which now contains all the elements from the nested arrays in a single flat array, is displayed using console.log(), resulting in the output: [1, 3, 4, 9, 9, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 99, 0, 0, 0, 100].*/
