/*
The code initializes two variables, a and b, with numeric values 1 and 0 respectively
The first console.log(typeof a) prints the data type of a, which is initially a number. 
The next line a = Boolean(a) converts a to a boolean,  and the subsequent console.log(typeof a) prints the new data type, which is now boolean. 
The following console.log(a) prints the value of a, which is true since the boolean conversion of a non-zero number is true.
