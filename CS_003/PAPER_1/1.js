/*
The given code block consists of logical AND (&&) and logical OR (||) operators, along with some values. Let's analyze each line:

console.log(22 && 44);

Output: 44
Explanation: The && operator returns the right operand when the left operand is truthy; otherwise, it returns the left operand. In this case, both operands are truthy, so it returns the right operand, which is 44.
console.log(55 && 0 && 22);

Output: 0
Explanation: The first two operands are truthy, but the third operand is falsy (0). The && operator returns the first falsy value encountered, so it outputs 0.
console.log(0 && 2 && 5);

Output: 0
Explanation: The first operand is falsy (0), so the && operator immediately returns it without evaluating the subsequent operands.
console.log(22 || 44);

Output: 22
Explanation: The || operator returns the left operand when it is truthy; otherwise, it returns the right operand. In this case, the left operand is truthy (22), so it outputs 22.
console.log(55 || 0 || 22);

Output: 55
Explanation: The || operator returns the first truthy operand encountered. In this case, the first operand (55) is truthy, so it outputs 55 without evaluating the subsequent operands.
console.log(0 || 2 || 5);

Output: 2
Explanation: The || operator returns the first truthy operand. In this case, the first operand (0) is falsy, so it moves to the next operand (2) and outputs it.
console.log("" && "pritvi");

Output: ""
Explanation: The && operator returns the first falsy operand. In this case, the first operand ("") is falsy, so it outputs "" without evaluating the second operand.*/
