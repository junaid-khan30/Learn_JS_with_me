var a = 4;
var b = 0;
console.log(a + b);
var string = +'456';
console.log(typeof a);
console.log(typeof string);
var str1 = "The";
var str2 = "School";
console.log(str1 + str2);

/*
console.log(a + b); - Outputs the result of adding a and b, which is 4. The + operator is used for addition in this context.

var string = +'456'; - Converts the string '456' to a number using the unary + operator. The result is stored in the variable string.

console.log(typeof a); - Outputs the data type of variable a, which is a number.

console.log(typeof string); - Outputs the data type of the variable string, which is also a number after the conversion.

console.log(str1 + str2); - Concatenates the strings stored in variables str1 and str2, resulting in the output 'TheSchool'.

In summary, the code demonstrates addition of numeric variables, conversion of a string to a number using the unary + operator, and concatenation of two strings. 
The output types are determined using the typeof operator.
