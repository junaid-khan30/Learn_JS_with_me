var a = "6";
var b = "9";
console.log(typeof a);
a = Number(a);
console.log(typeof a);

/*
The code initializes two variables, a and b, with the string values "6" and "9" respectively. 
The console.log(typeof a) statement outputs the data type of variable a, which is initially a string, so it prints "string". 
Then, the code converts the value of a to a number using Number(a), and the result is assigned back to a. 
The subsequent console.log(typeof a) statement outputs the new data type of a after the conversion, which is now a number.
