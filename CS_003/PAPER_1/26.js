var t = 15;
var q = 1;
console.log(++t + t++ + 1);
console.log(t);
/*

console.log(++t + t++ + 1); - Evaluates the expression from left to right:

++t: Pre-increments t to 16.
t++: Uses the current value of t (16) and then post-increments t to 17.
1: Adds 1 to the result.
The sum is 16 + 16 + 1 = 33, which is the output. However, the post-increment of t means it is now 17.
console.log(t); - Outputs the current value of t, which is 17 after the operations in the first line.

In summary, the code demonstrates the order of operations in a complex expression involving pre-increment, post-increment, and addition, 
resulting in the output values of 32 and 17 for the two console.log statements.*/
