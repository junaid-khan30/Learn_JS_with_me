/*
var even = []; var odd = [];: These lines initialize two empty arrays, even and odd, but they are not used in this code block.

var arr = [9, 5, 6, 6, 9, 3, 0, 5, 2, 9, 1];: This initializes an array arr with eleven numeric elements.

for (var i = 0; i < Math.floor(arr.length / 2); i++) {: This initiates a for loop that iterates from 0 to half of the length of the array.

console.log(arr[2 * i]);: This prints the element at every even index (2 * i). It effectively prints every second element of the array.

Now, let's break down the reasoning:

The loop runs for values of i from 0 to Math.floor(arr.length / 2) - 1.
The console.log(arr[2 * i]); statement prints elements at indices 0, 2, 4, ..., up to the last even index before the midpoint of the array
