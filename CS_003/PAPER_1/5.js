/*The given code block initiates a while loop with the condition i <= 10. 
However, the loop is set up to continually decrement i (--i), 
creating an infinite loop that never meets the exit condition. 
As a result, the loop will continuously print the value of i, 
which starts at 0 and decreases indefinitely. 
The code will not terminate, and there won't be any output due to the infinite loop.
