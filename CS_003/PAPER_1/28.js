/*
The if statement checks the truthiness of the expression inside the parentheses. In this case, the expression is 0.

JavaScript treats 0 as falsy in a boolean context. Therefore, the condition in the if statement evaluates to false.

Since the condition is false, the code inside the else block is executed.

The console.log("out"); statement inside the else block is executed, and "out" is printed to the console
